# Additional Input for Beatmap Version 3.0.0

## Sliders
When exactly selecting 2 color notes(need direction), press `T` to create a slider between them.
The slider contains two notes, which indicate its 2 additional points in `Bezier Curves`. Those two note can be color-inverted(`mouse mid`), tweaked(`alt` + `scroll`)

## Chains
When exactly selecting 2 color notes(first one needs direction), press `G` to convert them into chains.
The header of chain(with arrow) can be color-inverted(`mouse mid`), tweaked(`alt` + `scroll`)

## TODO
- Undo for new introduced actions
- Set transparency correctly
- Select animation for slider/chains
- Box selection for slider?
- Counters

## Bugs
A lot...
