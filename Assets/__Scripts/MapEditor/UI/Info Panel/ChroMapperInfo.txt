Here at Chroma® we value your eye-cone thingies.

A recent trend of duochromitis has plagued the VR community this last year, and we've decided to balance the playing field.

Chroma®, and it's big brother ChromaToggle™, can bring you up from your sad, rainbowless life into a world of Pentachrome™ magic. Experience the joy of having up to six different colours of blocks flying towards you at break neck speed! If that's not enough for you, we even offer a cacophony of Technicolour© lightwaves, to bring your eyes to their knees!

Now, with something as brilliant and Nobel Peace Price worthy as the Chroma Suite™, specialized software needs to be created to handle these beasts of technological engineering. That's where ChroMapper® comes into play!

ChroMapper™ makes it easy for the everyday Joe to use the power of Chroma© RGB™ to create lightshows and maps that are far superior to their duochromatic counterparts! Reality Check Through The Skull? Slap some Chroma on that mofo and you've got yourself a map worthy of Cube Community!

So, what are you waiting for? Stop living in your sad two-color world and join us enlightened individuals with the power of Chroma® RGB and ChroMapper™!
